## About this privacy policy

This privacy policy explains how we (University College London) collect and use, 
 your personal data when you use the present website.

Personal data is any information about you by which you can be identified. 

## What information you provide to us

By accessing this website, a third party (?) collects information from the device 
you use to access this website, such as the IP address, 
which is a numerical code to identify your device that can provide information 
about the country, region or city where you are based). This information is stored in server logs.

This ***third party*** (Netlify, Google Fonts) retains server logs containing the IP address of all requests 
to this server no more than 90 days. Before deleting these records, ***third party*** 
anonymises them to count the number of visits by X, Y, and date of visit. This anonymised
information is shared with us to help us improve the website.

The EWAC alcohol consumption questionnaire does not collect or transfer any information 
inputted into this questionnaire. This is because the web page is build using a client-side 
script, meaning all the calculations are done by your browser. The data you input into the
 questionnaire is momentarily stored in the browser. When you press 'submit', the browser
 calculates the alcohol consumption, and all input information is erased. All information
 is erased when you leave the page, for instance by closing your browser tab.

Neither the input, or the results, are transmitted at any point. 

As a result, this questionnaire is safe to use in a clinical environment.
