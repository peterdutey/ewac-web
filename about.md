## What is EWAC?

Alcohol is responsible for 5% of the global burden of ill health, 
yet individuals are not always aware of how much alcohol they drink, and 
whether this is likely to damage their future health.

EWAC stands for Estimated Weekly Alcohol Consumption. It can be measured
using a short questionnaire known as the Extended AUDIT-C made up of three 
items measuring

* quantity
* frequency and
* intensity of alcohol use.

This brief questionnaire is commonly used by doctors and nurses in health care services across the world.

<abbr title="Estimated Weekly Alcohol Consumption">EWAC</abbr> is calculated by adding the product of quantity by frequency to the intensity of alcohol use.

You can try it yourself on this website using [our <abbr title="Estimated Weekly Alcohol Consumption">EWAC</abbr> Web App](/questionnaire).

## How reliable is it?

A team of researchers validated <abbr title="Estimated Weekly Alcohol Consumption">EWAC</abbr> in a random sample of over 22,000 individuals aged 
16 years or more in England, designed to be representative of English households. 
EWAC was compared with a 'gold standard' alcohol interview schedule known as the 
'Graduated-Frequency questionnaire'.
 
The study is currently undergoing independent review by an academic journal.

The study found that <abbr title="Estimated Weekly Alcohol Consumption">EWAC</abbr> 
could be reliably presented as an interval of plus or minus 2 UK units (8mL or 10g of pure alcohol). 
Such an interval contains the 'gold standard' for 50% of individuals. But it is important to know 
 that the 'gold standard' contains error of its own, so the interval will in fact be accurate for a large majority 
 of individuals.
