This accessibility statement applies to the entire EWAC website.

This website is run by the University of Southampton. We want as many people as possible to be able to use this website. For example, that means you should be able to:

* change colours, contrast levels and fonts
* zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen
* navigate most of the website using just a keyboard
* navigate most of the website using speech recognition software
* listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)

We have also made the website text as simple as possible to understand.

## How accessible this website is

[Note: use this section to provide information that a disabled user can act on - for example, avoid a particular section of the website, or request an alternative version rather than waste time trying to make it work with their assistive technology. Try to list in order of most impact to least impact.]

We know some parts of this website are not fully accessible:

    the text will not reflow in a single column when you change the size of the browser window

### Enforcement procedure

The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) is responsible for enforcing the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018 (the 'accessibility regulations'). If you're not happy with how we respond to your complaint, contact the [Equality Advisory and Support Service (EASS)](https://www.equalityadvisoryservice.com/).

## Technical information about this website's accessibility

The University of Southampton is committed to making its website accessible, in accordance with the [Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/952/contents/made).


### Compliance status


Our website endeavours to conform to the latest [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1, AA](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/). Whilst the University of Southampton strives to adhere to the accepted guidelines and standards for web accessibility, it may not always be possible to ensure ease of use for all those viewing these pages. 

If your website is either partially compliant or not compliant WCAG 2.1 AA standard, you’ll need to explain why. This will be due to one or both of the following:

    non-compliances - this means the content in question is in scope of the regulations, but there’s an accessibility problem with it
    an exemption - this means the inaccessible content is out of scope of the regulations, or it’d be a disproportionate burden for you to make it accessible

There’s a legally required way of expressing the compliance status of your website, so do not change it. The 3 options are as follows:]

This website is fully compliant with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1 AA standard.

This website is partially compliant with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1 AA standard, due to [insert one of the following: ‘the non-compliances’, ‘the exemptions’ or ‘the non-compliances and exemptions’] listed below.

This website is not compliant with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1 AA standard. The [insert one of the following: ‘non-compliances’, ‘exemptions’ or ‘non-compliances and exemptions’] are listed below.

[Note: delete the options that do not apply.]

## Non-accessible content

[Note: if the website is fully compliant with the WCAG 2.1 AA standard, you can leave the ‘Non-accessible content’ section out.
 
The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.

### Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations

[Note: In this subsection, list:

    accessibility problems
    which of the WCAG 2.1 AA success criteria the problem fails on
    when you plan to fix the problem

Do not include any problems where you’re claiming disproportionate burden, or where the problem is outside the scope of the accessibility regulations (those should go in the subsections below).]

Some images do not have a text alternative, so people using a screen reader cannot access the information. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.1.1 (non-text content).

We plan to add text alternatives for all images by September 2020. When we publish new content we’ll make sure our use of images meets accessibility standards.

### Disproportionate burden

[Note: in this subsection list accessibility problems you’re claiming would be a disproportionate burden to fix

Bear in mind that something which is a disproportionate burden now will not necessarily be a disproportionate burden forever. If the circumstances change, your ability to claim disproportionate burden may change too.]

We’ve assessed the cost of fixing the issues with navigation and accessing information, and with interactive tools and transactions. We believe that doing so now would be a disproportionate burden within the meaning of the accessibility regulations. We will make another assessment when the supplier contract is up for renewal, likely to be in [rough timing].

### Content that’s not within the scope of the accessibility regulations


## Preparation of this accessibility statement

This statement was prepared on 1 September 2020. It was last reviewed on 1 September 2020.

This website was last tested on 1 September 2020. The test was carried out by our own team.

We used this approach to deciding on a sample of pages to test [add link to explanation of how you decided which pages to test].

* tested with WebbIE Web Browser
* tested with NVDA

[Note: you do not have to use this approach to sampling, but you should link to a full explanation of what you tested and how you chose it. If you get a third party auditor to test your website for you, they should include sampling details in test report - so you can just to link to that.]

You can read the full accessibility test report [add link to report].

[Note: publishing the test report is optional, but doing so may allow you to make your accessibility statement shorter and more focused.]
